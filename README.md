4. Additionally, download the `remote.apk` file from the same link and install it on your Android device.

To establish a connection, ensure that your phone and PC are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. You can also use a personal hotspot if desired.

Next, run the `main.py` script to start the server. Take note of the IP address and port number displayed on the screen.
